Mazegame v4 for Commodore 64.
A 100% basic game by Eyvind Ebsen.
Created oct. 2024


Overview
--------
A commodore c64 basic game of mazes.
Quickly get our hero to save the beautiful princess,
before her lifeforce runs out.


Features
--------
Choose between generating mazes using the CPU,
which is rather slow, or load one of the
1.200+ precalculated mazes quickly from disk.

Top 10 highscore. Saves to disk.

Joystick controlled. (port 2)

Colorful graphics.

Endless eons of fun :)


Updates
-------
v4:
Got rid of the precalculation.
Hiscore now saves to disk.
fixed alot of cosmetic bugs.

v3:
spending a bunch of memory, 
draws the maze 5 times faster.
requires a slow 1-time precalculation :(


Fun facts
---------
There is 2^958 possible mazes.

A maze can be broken down into 125 bytes.
5 byte for a line, times 25 of those.

The first data file of mazes was a SEQ file.
Imagine the time it would take to seek to the last maze.
So made a converter that would read the SEQ from device 8,
saving as a REL file on device 9. Took a while.

The data is now in a REL file for quick access,

Some emulators dont work properly with REL files.
Tested and works with Vice (GTK) and emulation of
disk drive 1541-II.
